      <p class="content">
        Rowdy Rydes was started by a dedicated software developer trying to find ways to minimize wasted time in his day. The developer who was a student at the time, stumbled upon the idea after repeatedly encountering people nearby who were heading to the same place he was. They would normally pick him up for free which was fine for the time however, after inflation hit staggering numbers and other transportation apps became too expensive, our student decided to leverage the convenience of having people nearby to create a carpool-rideshare app unlike any other. It was cheaper than the traditional ones so the students at his college that often ran into similar situations would also benefit as the target audience. He envisioned it to be most effective in situations where, say, your neighbor was heading to a store you need to go to. In this instance, instead of calling a 15 dollar uber, you can catch a ride with them for 5 dollars with little to no hassle for the driver! They are heading to the same place anyways so they earn money for a small detour, maximizing the efficiency of their time.
